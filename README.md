# MRB Debug Probe

**MRB Debug Probe** is a standalone tool for real-time visualization of UART data generated by **Plecs Coder** on **TI LaunchPad XL** boards.  
It uses the UART on the USB cable to send and receive data. Received data is plotted in real time on a multi-channel scope. Users can also choose to log data to a CSV file.  
The executable runs on **any Windows computer** without Python or additional libraries.

## 💻 EXE version
✅ Works on any Windows PC  
✅ No Python or external dependencies required  
✅ No installation needed

## ⚙️ How to use it
1. Open the `UartExample.plecs` file.  
2. Copy the *MRB Debug Probe* subsystem together with the UART Serial block into your project.  
3. Run the EXE file or Python script.  
4. Click **Start** to view live Plecs CSV data.  
5. Choose **Yes** to log CSV data.  
6. Input values, gain values, axis limits, and window size can be changed online.  
7. To change the number of active (plotted) channels, turn the window with the scope off and start it again (you don’t need to turn off the whole program).

## 🐞 Possible bugs
As this is an early version of the program and I am developing it myself, the following situations might cause problems (to be fixed in future versions):  
- Closing the program before closing the plotting scope (the plotting scope should be closed first).  
- Trying to plot data with the USB cable not connected.
