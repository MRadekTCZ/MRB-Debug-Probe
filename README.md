# MRB Debug Probe

**MRB Debug Probe** is a standalone tool for real-time visualization of UART data generated by **Plecs Coder** on **TI LaunchPad XL** boards.  
It uses the UART on the USB cable to send and receive data. Received data is plotted in real time on a multi-channel scope. Users can also choose to log data to a CSV file.  
The executable runs on **any Windows computer** without Python or additional libraries.

## 💻 EXE version
✅ Works on any Windows PC  
✅ No Python or external dependencies required  
✅ No installation needed

## ✳️ Features
- Real-time plotting of UART/CSV data from LaunchPad XL + Plecs Coder  
- Adjustable **time window** and **axis limits**  
- Supports **1–8 channels** with individual names and gain control  
- Scope that can plot 8 values with 20 Hz refresh rate  
- 8 input fields — can be used for debugging or control tests
- Outputs and inputs **operate on uint16**, so the resolution is 16 bits

## ⚙️ How to use it
1. Open the `UartExample.plecs` file.  
2. Copy the *MRB Debug Probe* subsystem together with the UART Serial block into your project.
3. Turn off the external mode: *Coder options -> Target -> External mode -> Off*
4. Run the EXE file or Python script.  (It can take up to 30 seconds to start a program, so be patient)
5. Click **Start Plot** to view live Plecs data.  (After starting, it may take 10 second for plotter to appear)
6. Choose **Save CSV: Yes** to log CSV data.  
7. Input values, gain values, axis limits, and window size can be changed online.  
8. To change the number of active (plotted) channels, turn the window with the scope off and start it again (you don’t need to turn off the whole program).
9. Gain values are changed online with every refresh cycle
10. Input values are not changed online, you must click **Update Inputs** to assign new input values
11. Remember that data is sent as uint16, so all floats are parsed to integers. If you want to keep decimal number, you have to multiply them by gain *k* from plecs side and divide it by gain *1/k* on debug program side

## 🐞 Possible bugs
As this is an early version of the program and I am developing it myself, the following situations might cause problems (to be fixed in future versions):  
- Closing the program before closing the plotting scope (the plotting scope should be closed first).  
- Trying to plot data with the USB cable not connected.
