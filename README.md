# MRB Debug Probe

**MRB Debug Probe** is a standalone tool for real-time visualization of UART data generated by **Plecs Coder** on **TI LaunchPad XL** boards.  
It reads CSV-formatted serial data from a Plecs schematic and plots multiple channels live in one interactive window.  
The executable in the `MRB_DebugProbe/` folder runs on **any Windows computer** without Python or additional libraries.
